# SnakeMan🐍
### A nostalgic tribute, mixing the giant arcade games Snake and PacaMan
The game recreates the well-known Snake arcade game, spicing it up with the PacMan effect!

The creation of this game is intended as a learning experience, to grasp better game development concepts, such as:
 - Menu creation
 - Game states
 - Working with global and static values, that need to be accessed from any part of the project
 - Singleton method
 - Writing readable and maintainable code
